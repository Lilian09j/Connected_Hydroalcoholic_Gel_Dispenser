# Connected_Hydroalcoholic_Gel_Dispenser

  Hydroalcoholic Gel Dispenser that deliver a proper dose of gel if a hand is detected by an Ultrasonic sensor (HCSR-04).
  Made around an Arduino Uno board

  A gear rack commanded by a servo motor is used to press the gel bottle

  This dispenser is aware if someone badge with his school RFID card on a RC522 module (MIFARE protocol) but didnt took his gel dispense. That would generate an alarme on this following App :
  Mobile App made on AppInventor including voice commands to be informed of battery level as well as gel reserve
  A force-sensing resistor (FSR402) is used to mesure the weight of the jar, giving an indication about the remaining gel liquid quantity

  This product was presented at the **French Engineering Science Olympiads 2021 Edition**
